    <Body>The next time Easter will be this early will be the year 2228 (220 years from now).  Only the most elderly of our population have ever seen it this early (95 years old or older!).  The last time it was this early was 1913 (so if you're 95 or older, you are the only ones that were around for that!).



Easter is always the 1st Sunday after the 1st full moon after the Spring Equinox (which is March 20).  This dating of Easter is based on the lunar calendar that Hebrew people used to identify passover, which is why it moves around on our Roman calendar.



Based on the above, Easter can actually be one day earlier than this year, but that is pretty rare.  The next time it will be a day earlier, March 22, will be in the year 2285 (277 years from now).  The last time it was on March 22 was 1818.  So, no one alive today has or will ever see it any earlier than this year!</Body>

    <Title>The Blue Mountains Apple Pie Trail</Title>
    <Body>Along  the western plain of Georgian Bay, adjacent to the Escarpment that forms the historic Bruce Peninsula, Mother Nature and human nature have teamed up to create perfect conditions for apple pie. Look for the Blue Mountains Certification when you purchase yours. It means the pie is made from our great apples and baked right here. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;

The Apple Pie Trail runs from Collingwood through the Blue Mountains, to Thornbury, Meaford and the beautiful Beaver Valley with stops showcasing fresh apple products of the region's finest orchards, markets and restaurants. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;

    <Body>At 8:30 p.m. the world will turn off its lights for just one hour - Earth Hour - to show it is possible to take action on climate change and demonstrate that our individual actions add up to make a big difference. Switching off your lights is just one simple action that you can take to help and it sends a powerful message that we care about our planet.


Last year, Earth Hour was a huge success reaching over one billion people in more than 80 countries. In
Canada, over 10 million Canadians and thousands of businesses participated in more than 275 cities across the country.</Body>

    <Body>At 8:30 p.m. the world will turn off its lights for just one hour - Earth Hour - to show it is possible to take action on climate change and demonstrate that our individual actions add up to make a big difference. Switching off your lights is just one simple action that you can take to help and it sends a powerful message that we care about our planet.


Last year, Earth Hour was a huge success reaching over one billion people in more than 80 countries. In
Canada, over 10 million Canadians and thousands of businesses participated in more than 275 cities across the country.</Body>
